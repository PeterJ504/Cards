# Cards

Another simple project aimed at practicing using Python and OOP.

This is simple poker program. It currently deals random 5 card hands and then ranks them according to standard poker rules.

Future plans:

- Deal more than 5 cards - e.g. Stud
- Incorporate community cards to play Texas Hold 'em and Omaha.
